This is a simple game created to be played on LAN during boring lessons in school.
It's a top-down battle royale in which players always rotate.

### How to start playing
You have to download the game from this Github and open it as a project in Godot. Then you have to run it (F5).

To start, you need to connect to other players on LAN and one of you needs to choose "Create a server" option. Other players joint the game and type the servers IP address. The game starts when everybody presses "Ready".

### Controls
Mouse movement - move character

Left button - shoot

Right button - change rotation direction
